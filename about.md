I’m a Consultant at Ernst & Young in the Data Analytics practice under PI Advisory. Our team strives to help clients make fact-based decisions with data and use predictive analytics to improve bottomline performance. 

I majored in Economics & Statistics at the University of Toronto. A sample of my work is available under projects. 

Drop me an email hi@justinsjlee.com if you’d like to chat.
