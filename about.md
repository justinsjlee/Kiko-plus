## Hello

My name is Justin and I'm currently a digital analytics co-op student, on track to graduate from the University of Toronto in summer 2018. I like solving problems, discovering new insights and sharing my knowledge. I study statistics & economics, which lets me utilize my analytical skills to solve real-world problems. I enjoy this deeply and look forward to working with new & interesting data. 

Coffee, comic books, squash, documentaries & podcasts are the things that bring joy to my life.
