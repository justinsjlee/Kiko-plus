My name is Justin and Iâ€™m a digital analytics intern, on track to graduate from the University of Toronto in the summer of 2018. I like solving complex problems, discovering new insights and sharing my knowledge with those around me. I study statistics & economics which involves using data + critical thinking to tackle real-world problems. I find this work deeply gratifying and look forward to working with new, exciting data.

For a full description of my experience & technical skillset, please refer to my [resume](http://www.justinsjlee.com/Resume.pdf). You can view some of the projects that I've worked on [here](justinsjlee.com/projects). I also write occasionally about numbers, design & culture [here](justinsjlee.com/blog).
