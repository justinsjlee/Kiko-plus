## Hello

My name is Justin and I'm a digital analytics co-op student, on track to graduate from the University of Toronto in summer 2018. I like solving problems, discovering new insights and sharing my knowledge with those around me. I study statistics & economics, which lets me use my analytical skills to solve real-world problems. I enjoy this deeply and look forward to working with new & exciting data. 

You can view some of the projects that I've worked on here. For a full description of my capabilities & experience, please refer to my resume.

I also write occasionally about numbers, design & culture here. Otherwise, my time is mostly consumed by squash, comic books, documentaries & podcasts.
