Iâ€™m a Consultant at [EY](https://www.ey.com/en_gl) in the Data Analytics practice under [PI Advisory](https://www.ey.com/ca/en/services/advisory/performance-improvement). My team strives to help clients make [fact-based decisions](https://hbr.org/2010/01/better-decisions-through-analy) with data and use [predictive analytics](https://www.huffingtonpost.com/phil-simon/predictive-analytics_b_2802994.html) to improve performance. 

I majored in Economics & Statistics at the [University of Toronto](https://www.utoronto.ca/). A sample of my work is available under [projects](http://www.justinsjlee.com/projects/). 

Always open to chatting with thoughtful and enthusiastic people [hi@justinsjlee.com](mailto:hi@justinsjlee.com).
