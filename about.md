## Hello

My name is Justin and Iâ€™m a digital analytics intern, on track to graduate from the University of Toronto in the summer of 2018. I like solving complex problems, discovering new insights and sharing my knowledge with those around me. I study statistics & economics which lets me use numbers + logical reasoning + critical thinking to solve real-world problems. I find this deeply gratifying and look forward to working with new & exciting data.

For a full description of my capabilities & experience, please refer to my resume here.

You can view some of the projects that I've worked on here.

I also write occasionally about numbers, design & culture here. 

Currently based in ~~Vancouver~~ Toronto.
