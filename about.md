4th year student at the University of Toronto specializing in Applied Statistics with 16 months of co-op work experience in a business intelligence and analytics function seeking a role that supports data-driven decision making and leverages predictive analytics to create value.

My specialties:

* BI reporting/dashboard automation via ETLs.
* Statistical modelling & supervised machine learning.
* Experimental design, hypothesis testing & A/B testing. 
* Storytelling with numbers & data visualization.

Projects I’ve worked on: Customer Segmentation, Marketing Mix Modelling, Multi-Channel Attribution, Digital Analytics Implementation, Reporting & Optimization.

I occasionally write about new things I’m learning at work & school under [projects](http://www.justinsjlee.com/projects).

Otherwise doodling, hiking, watching cyberpunk films & documentaries, drinking too much coffee and exploring the great universe.
