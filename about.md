## Hello

My name is Justin and I'm a digital analytics co-op student, on track to graduate from the University of Toronto in summer 2018. I like solving problems, discovering new insights and sharing my knowledge with those around me. I study statistics & economics, which lets me use my analytical skills to solve real-world problems. I enjoy this deeply and look forward to working with new & exciting data. 

Coffee, squash, comic books, documentaries & podcasts are the things that bring me joy.

For a full description of my capabilities & experience, please refer to my resume.

If you'd like to chat about any of the above, I can be reached at [mailto:justinsj.lee@mail.utoronto.ca]

Currently based in ~~Seoul~~  ~~Vancouver~~  Toronto.
