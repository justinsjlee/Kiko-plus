## Hello

My name is Justin and I'm a digital analytics co-op student, on track to graduate from the University of Toronto in summer 2018. I like solving problems, discovering new insights and sharing my knowledge with those around me. I study statistics & economics, which lets me use my analytical skills to solve real-world problems. I find this deeply gratifying and look forward to working with new & exciting data.

For a full description of my capabilities & experience, please refer to my resume.

You can view some of the projects that I've worked on here.

I also write occasionally about numbers, design & culture here. 

Currently based in ~~Vancouver~~ Toronoto
