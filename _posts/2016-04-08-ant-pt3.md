#Analyzing Ant Movement Patterns - Part III

One of the main projects I did in my third year statistics class (STA303) was a three-part analysis on ant behavior data collected by Peter Nonacs from UCLA. The dataset and a data dictionary and some relevant background information can be found [here](http://www.stat.ucla.edu/projects/datasets/ant-explanation.html). Throughout the report, a number of questions are asked & answered to discover some insight from the data. You can view the report [here](http://www.justinsjlee.com/A3_Report.pdf) and the R code [here](http://www.justinsjlee.com/A3.R).
