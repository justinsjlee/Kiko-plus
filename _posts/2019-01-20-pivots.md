For the data analyst, Excel is undoubtedly the tool for doing quick and dirty calculations a.k.a building pivot tables. However, recently I've been running into some ugly situations with analyzing large files in Excel. Trying to open a 1GB file (~1 million rows) on my 32-bit Excel leads to extremely sluggish performance and after Ctrl + Shift + Del-ing out a couple times, I was starting to lose my sanity.

#### Thankfully, we have R. 

This post is to demonstrate how to quickly create pivot tables in R with the `dplyr` and `tidyr` packages. The content is designed for anyone who wants to learn R and for me to reference later on. 

For the examples below, we will use data on a telecom's customers. The dataset can be found on [IBM Watson Analytics Sample Data](https://www.ibm.com/communities/analytics/watson-analytics-blog/guide-to-sample-datasets/). The dataset contains:

* A Unique customer ID 
* Churn status - Customers who left within the last month
* Services that each customer has signed up for - phone, internet, tv, etc...
* Accounting details - tenure, contract, payment method, invoice amounts, etc...
* Demographic info - gender, age range, and if they have partners/dependents

We start off by loading the data

```R
df <- read.csv(url("https://community.watsonanalytics.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/WA_Fn-UseC_-Telco-Customer-Churn.csv"))
```

Thankfully this data is very clean, so we can start analyzing right away. A common question from the business might be about the breakdown of customers by the products/services they have.

To answer this, we pivot by the PhoneService column and count the rows. 

```R
library(dplyr)

df %>%
  group_by(PhoneService) %>%
  summarise(counts = n()) 
```

|PhoneService | counts|
|:------------:|:------:|
|No           |    682|
|Yes          |   6361|


First we have to load the `dplyr` package, which gives us functions like `group_by`, `summarise` and `n`. If you haven't installed it already, you can run `install.packages("dplyr")`. Once loaded, we can use the functions that allow us to group by and sum up the counts for our dataset. 

A natural follow-up question might be about the monthly revenue from phone subscribers/non-subscribers. 

```R
df %>%
  group_by(PhoneService) %>%
  summarise(counts = n(), monthly.revenue = sum(MonthlyCharges))   
```

| PhoneService | counts | monthly.revenue |
|:--------:|:-------:|:--------:|
| No   | 682   | 28663.5   |
| Yes   | 6361   | 427453.1   |


As seen above, we can convineintly sum up the monthly charges column by phone subscription status by using the sum function. Notice that you can namethe new column when calculating the sum of monthly charges; Otherwise it will just show up as `sum(MonthlyCharges)`. 

Counts are useful, but a proportions are obviously easier to interpret.

```R
df %>%
  group_by(PhoneService) %>%
  summarise(counts = n(),
            monthly.revenue = sum(MonthlyCharges)) %>%
  mutate(count.prop = counts/sum(counts),
         mr.prop = monthly.revenue/sum(monthly.revenue))   
```

| PhoneService | counts| monthly\.revenue | count\.prop | mr.prop 
|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:
|No|682|28663|0.0968337|0.0628425
|Yes|6361|427453|0.9031663|0.9371575


`mutate` allows us to create new columns from the data that is being passed down by the `%>%`. The pipe  funnels down data by grouping it, summarising (totalling counts and revenue) to our mutate function. 

We can group by multiple columns too. Let's see the breakdown of customers with multiple lines as well.  We'll round the proportions and multiplying by 100 for a cleaner look.  

```R
df %>%
  group_by(PhoneService,
           MultipleLines) %>%
  summarise(counts = n(),
            monthly.revenue = sum(MonthlyCharges)) %>%
  mutate(count.prop = counts/sum(counts),
         mr.prop = monthly.revenue/sum(monthly.revenue)) %>%
  mutate(count.prop = round(count.prop*100),
         mr.prop = round(mr.prop*100))  
```

| PhoneService |  MultipleLines   | counts | monthly.revenue | count.prop | mr.prop |
|:------------:|:----------------:|:------:|:---------------:|:----------:|:--------------------:|
|      No      | No phone service |  682   |     28663.5     |    100     |         100          |
|     Yes      |        No        |  3390  |    183721.2     |     53     |          43          |
|     Yes      |       Yes        |  2971  |    243731.9     |     47     |          57          |


We can also use filters to only see relevant information. Filtering for `PhoneServce == "Yes"` passes down only rows with that meet the condition to the `group_by` function.

```R
df %>%
  filter(PhoneService == "Yes") %>%
  group_by(PhoneService,
           MultipleLines) %>%
  summarise(counts = n(),
            monthly.revenue = sum(MonthlyCharges)) %>%
  mutate(count.prop = counts/sum(counts),
         mr.prop = monthly.revenue/sum(monthly.revenue))       
```

| PhoneService | MultipleLines | counts | monthly.revenue | count.prop | mr.prop |
|:------------:|:-------------:|:------:|:---------------:|:----------:|:--------------------:|
|     Yes      |      No       |  3390  |    183721.2     | 0.5329351  |      0.4298045       |
|     Yes      |      Yes      |  2971  |    243731.9     | 0.4670649  |      0.5701955       |

Pivotting on another variable via the columns is a common exercise in excel. Let's breakdown the sum of monthly revenue by contract type
```R
library(tidyr)

df %>%
  filter(PhoneService == "Yes") %>%
  group_by(PhoneService, MultipleLines, Contract) %>%
  summarise(counts = n()) %>%
  spread(key = Contract, value = counts)
```

| PhoneService | MultipleLines | Month-to-month | One year | Two year |
|:------------:|:-------------:|:--------------:|:--------:|:--------:|
|     Yes      |      No       |      2017      |   712    |   661    |
|     Yes      |      Yes      |      1482      |   616    |   873    |


The average revenue from each customer may be of interest too. We simply replace the `n()` function with the `mean()`.

```R
df %>%
  filter(PhoneService == "Yes") %>%
  group_by(PhoneService, MultipleLines, Contract) %>%
  summarise(avg.monthly.revenue = round(mean(MonthlyCharges),1))%>%
  spread(key = Contract, value = avg.monthly.revenue)
```

| PhoneService | MultipleLines | Month-to-month | One year | Two year |
|:------------:|:-------------:|:--------------:|:--------:|:--------:|
|     Yes      |      No       |      58.5      |   52.3   |   43.1   |
|     Yes      |      Yes      |      84.7      |   84.4   |   75.9   |

With this creating pivot tables with data too big for Excel should be a breeze. Of course R has more capabilities than just wrangling data.

### What else can we do with R? 

One is wrangling the data in the desired format. Since our services (Phone, Internet, TV) are one-hot encoded (separate dummy variable columns for each service), we can't a breakdown for all services. 


|PhoneService |InternetService |StreamingTV |Services                 |
|:-----------:|:--------------:|:----------:|:-----------------------:|
|No           |DSL             |No          |Internet                 |
|Yes          |No              |No          |Phone          	        |
|Yes          |DSL             |No          |Phone /  Internet        |
|No           |DSL             |No          |Internet                 |
|Yes          |Fiber optic     |No          |Phone /  Internet        |
|Yes          |Fiber optic     |Yes         |Phone /  Internet  / TV  |

By using the `paste` and `ifelse` functions we can create a new column called `Services` which gives us one column for all three subscriptions. 

```R
df %>%
  mutate(Services = ifelse(PhoneService == "Yes",
                           "Phone/ ", "")) %>%
  mutate(Services = ifelse(InternetService %in% c("DSL",
  "Fiber optic"), paste(Services, "Internet ", "/"), Services)) %>%
  mutate(Services = ifelse(StreamingTV == "Yes",
                       paste(Services, "TV", "/"), Services)) %>%
  group_by(Services, Contract) %>%
  summarise(avg.monthly.revenue = round(mean(MonthlyCharges), 1)) %>%
  spread(key = Contract, value = avg.monthly.revenue)
```

|         Services         | Month-to-month | One year | Two year |
|:------------------------:|:--------------:|:--------:|:--------:|
|       Internet  /        |      32.0      |   38.2   |   43.0   |
|     Internet  / TV /     |      47.1      |   52.3   |   57.4   |
|          Phone/          |      20.4      |   20.8   |   21.8   |
|   Phone/  Internet  /    |      69.6      |   71.3   |   74.7   |
| Phone/  Internet  / TV / |      91.4      |   93.6   |   95.7   |
