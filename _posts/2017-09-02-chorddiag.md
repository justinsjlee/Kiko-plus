One interesting method of data visualization I learned about during my co-op term is the chord diagram. I found this graph to be very useful in displaying flows between multiple groups in a concise manner.

which according to wikipedia is a graphical method of displaying the inter-relationships between data in a matrix. 

You can view the interactive graph [here](http://www.justinsjlee.com/telco_ex.html). Note: The numbers from the examples are solely for the purpose of this post.
