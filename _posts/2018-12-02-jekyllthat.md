As part of a course I took in the last year of my undergrad at UofT (STA490), I advised researchers from the department of  ecology on statistical model development. The 8-month project composed of providing cleansing, analysis, visualization, modelling in R and reporting in Pages, Markdown and LaTeX.

Currently working to update the page with an R Markdown document with all the steps. In the mean time, please refer to the [final report.](http://www.justinsjlee.com/Final%20Report%20v2.pdf)
