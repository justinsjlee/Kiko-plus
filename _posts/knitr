This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code.

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*.

``` r
plot(cars)
```

![](empty_knit_files/figure-markdown_github/unnamed-chunk-1-1.png)

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.


Counts are useful, but a proportions are obviously easier to interpret.

    df %>%
      group_by(PhoneService) %>%
      summarise(counts = n(),
                monthly.revenue = sum(MonthlyCharges)) %>%
      mutate(count.prop = counts/sum(counts),
             monthly.revenue.prop = monthly.revenue/sum(monthly.revenue))

    ## # A tibble: 2 x 5
    ##   PhoneService counts monthly.revenue count.prop monthly.revenue.prop
    ##   <fct>         <int>           <dbl>      <dbl>                <dbl>
    ## 1 No              682          28664.     0.0968               0.0628
    ## 2 Yes            6361         427453.     0.903                0.937

`mutate` allows us to create new columns from the data that is being
passed down by the `%>%`. The pipe funnels down data by grouping it,
summarising (totalling counts and revenue) to our mutate function.


We'll start off by reading in our data and glimpsing at it

``` r
library(knitr)
```

    ## Warning: package 'knitr' was built under R version 3.5.2

``` r
kable(head(iris[,1:3]), format = "markdown")
```
