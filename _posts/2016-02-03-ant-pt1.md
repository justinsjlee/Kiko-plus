#Analyzing Ant Movement Patterns - Part I

One of the main projects I did in my third year statistics class (STA303) was a three-part analysis on ant behavior data collected by Peter Nonacs from UCLA. The dataset and a data dictionary and some relevant background information can be found [here](http://www.stat.ucla.edu/projects/datasets/ant-explanation.html). Throughout the report, a number of questions are asked & answered to discover some insight from the data.

Throughout the report, I demonstrate how to perform Two Sample t-tests, Tukey HSD corrected tests, 2-Way ANOVA, build linear regression models and perform graphical analysis with histograms, boxplots, interaction plots and other appropriate charts. The report ends by determining the foraging strategy of certain ant colonies. One colony turns out to have a *Energy Centric* mentality because they send out ants with less energy further away from the mound where they have a higher chance of not coming back, but overall energy (mass) of the colony is conserved. Another colony showed that ants have increasing mass when they were further away from the mound. This would be considered a *Worker-Centric* mentality since ants who are further from the mound have a higher risk of death, but that risk is mitigated somewhat by sending bigger ants further. In the following (Pt II & Pt III), I'll further investigate the data guided by questions from my Professor and rethink some of the assumptions we made in this report. 

You can view the report [here](http://www.justinsjlee.com/A1_Report.pdf) and the R code [here](http://www.justinsjlee.com/A1.R) or below.
