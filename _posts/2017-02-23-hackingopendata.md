You can view the interactive dashboard [here](https://public.tableau.com/profile/justin.sj.lee#!/vizhome/TuitionCostsRisingAcrossCanada/Main).

As expected, the general trend is upwards for undergraduate tuition in Canadian Universities over the past 5 years. I displayed the data from Years 2012 ~ 2017 using a slopegraph; this method makes it easy to spot any outliers like tuition decreasing over the years, which occurs in certain cases. 

Hovering over a point will give you the exact Tuition for the academic year in a province. Please toggle the discipline menu on the right to discover different fields.
