You can view the full interactive dashboard [on Tableau Public](https://public.tableau.com/profile/justin.sj.lee#!/vizhome/TuitionCostsRisingAcrossCanada/Main).

Hovering over a point will give you the average tuition for that academic year. To explore trends in tuition for different fields of study, select the desired discipline on the right.

As expected, tuition is increasing for most undergraduate programs in Canadian universities over the past 5 years. The data is displayed via a slopegraph; this method makes it easy to spot any outliers such as decreasing tuition or very steep increases YoY. 

To learn more about slope graphs, check out Edward Tufte's [comprehensive introduction here](https://www.edwardtufte.com/bboard/q-and-a-fetch-msg?msg_id=0003nk).

This viz was made for Tableau Public's #HackingOpenData project with the help of Melissa Schuurman.
