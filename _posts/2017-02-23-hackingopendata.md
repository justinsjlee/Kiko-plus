You can view the interactive dashboard [here](https://public.tableau.com/profile/justin.sj.lee#!/vizhome/TuitionCostsRisingAcrossCanada/Main).

As expected, the general trend is upwards for undergraduate tuition in Canadian Universities. I displayed the data from Years 2012 ~ 2017 using a slopegraph; this method makes it easy to spot any outliers like tuition decreasing over the years.
