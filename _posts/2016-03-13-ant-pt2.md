One of the main projects I did in my third year statistics class (STA303) was a three-part analysis on ant behavior data collected by Peter Nonacs from UCLA. The dataset and a data dictionary and some relevant background information can be found [here](http://www.stat.ucla.edu/projects/datasets/ant-explanation.html). A number of questions are asked in an attempt to discover some insight from the data with statistical analysis.

Some methods of analysis in this report include building regression models with weighted least squares, ordinary least squares, analyzing residual plots and evaluating logistic regression and its requirements.

You can view the report [here](http://www.justinsjlee.com/A2_Report.pdf) and the R code [here](http://www.justinsjlee.com/A2.R) or below.
